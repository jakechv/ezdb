#+TITLE: Todo

* TODO integrate skira eslint config
they have good defaults!
possibly also make a 'jake' eslint config that is similar
* TODO default config
- parameter to generate initial configuration file
- function to fill in unspecified information with sensible default parameters
* TODO add tests
test existing database functions to confirm that they function as desired with a postgres database
* TODO improve error handling
error handling could be improved to do more than log that something did not work
perhaps take other actions to ensure that things are accomplished
